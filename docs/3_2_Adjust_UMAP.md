# UMAP

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that preserves global and local structures, making it useful for visualizing high-dimensional data.

## Open the Filter

Double Click the **Clustering and Dimension Reduction** box.

The view panel will open.

Choose **Dimension Reduction: UMAP**

A data step will open.

Press **Reset** to allow modification.

Open the **Settings Panel** by clicking the tab.

Two settings influence how clumped together or separated the clusters are in the visualisation.

## Spread

Set spread to 2

## min-dist

Set min-dist to 0.75

*Note: UMAP also uses a seed to control randomness. You can perform the same stability checks for UMAP with this setting.

Press **Save**.
